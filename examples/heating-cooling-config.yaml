# Example Home Assistant YAML configuration for Heating/Cooling Card

# For Climate Entities (most common - e.g., Hue, Ecobee, Smart Thermostat)
# The card automatically reads these attributes:
# - current_temperature (from entity state or attributes)
# - target_temp_low (heating setpoint)
# - target_temp_high (cooling setpoint)

example_living_room:

  entity: climate.us_thermostat
  title: "Thermostat (°F)"
  min_temp: 60
  max_temp: 85
